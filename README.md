How to Run the Client App
To get started with the client app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt: git clone https://github.com/sriramsadineni/pizza-delivery-codetest

2. Open Client App Folder in VS Code
Navigate to the cloned repository using your file explorer or terminal. Locate the "Client App" folder and open it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other code editor of your choice: cd <repository_folder>/Client App
3. Run ng serve
The client app is built using Angular, and you need to use the Angular CLI to run it. In the terminal within the "Client App" folder, run the following command: ng serve
This command will start a local development server and compile the client app. Once the compilation is complete, you can access the app by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:4200.

That's it! You've successfully set up and launched the client app.

Remember that you can customize and enhance the app according to your needs. Enjoy coding!
